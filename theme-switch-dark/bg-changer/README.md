# Background Color Changer

### Rainbow buttons are given to change the background color accordingly.

- Using react hook "useState" to change background color.
  // using useState hook
- const [color, setColor] = useState('default value')
- here "color" is a variable and "setColor" is the function used to change the value of variable "color".
- Because we need to implement the color-change instantaneously, hence we will the "setColor" function as a callback.
- This will update the DOM (ie. bg-color) as soon as the button is clicked.
