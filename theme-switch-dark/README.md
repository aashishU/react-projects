# Theme Switch to Dark Mode

- Here we have created a card.
- The theme of the card can be toggled between dark and light mode by using Context API.
- This is a better way to write code for Context than what we did in "mini-context".
- Refer this program when creating and using Context.

#### Better way to create and use Context

- In mini-context project, we learned how to create and use Context.
- But here we learn a better way to create and use Context in an Application.

#### How to create and use Context

_Step 1_ : Create "theme.js" file inside "context" folder.

- Here we have  
  (1) Created a new Context.  
  (2) Made all children components aware about the existence of that context.  
  (3) Created a Custom Hook (eg. useTheme) that specifies what context we are using, beforehand.
